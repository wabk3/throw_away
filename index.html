          <p class="about-text">Young professional in sales looking to change careers to web development. Currently self-teaching myself HTML and CSS using freeCodeCamp, as well as other resources online. I am completely new to this, but am looking forward to the challenges and rewards
          that come hand-in-hand when working in web development, as well as the great community of web developers that come along with it! </p>
